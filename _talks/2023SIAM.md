**Abstract:** In this talk we consider the effects of a quadratic tax rate
levied against two agents with heterogeneous risk aversions
in a continuous-time, risk-sharing equilibrium model. The
goal of each agent is to choose a trading strategy according
to a mean variance criterion, for which an optimal strategy exists in closed form, as the solution to an FBSDE.
This tractable setup allows us to analyse the utility loss
incurred from taxation and show why an agent can benefit
from taxation before redistribution. Moreover, we additionally model the situation where agents have heterogeneous beliefs about the traded asset and discuss whether there exists an optimal tax that benefits the agents.
